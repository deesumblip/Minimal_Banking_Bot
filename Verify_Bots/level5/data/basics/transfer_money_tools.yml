      Demonstrates tool calling in a flow.
      The bot collects the necessary information, then the LLM
      can dynamically decide to call tools (like check_balance
      or process_transfer) based on the conversation context.
    steps:
      - collect: amount
        description: "transfer amount"
      - collect: recipient
        description: "recipient name or account"
      - collect: account_from
        description: "source account number"
      - action: action_process_transfer_with_tools
      # Note: Tools are registered in endpoints.yml and can be called
      # dynamically by the LLM during the conversation
