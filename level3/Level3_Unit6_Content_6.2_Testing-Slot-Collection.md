# 6.2 Testing Slot Collection

After training in Lab 6.1, you'll test the bot in Inspector to confirm slot collection and persistence.

**Lab 6.2** walks you through starting Inspector (on Codio use the Rasa Inspect tab; locally open a browser), testing slot collection by saying something like "Check my balance" so the bot asks for the account and you provide it, testing slot persistence by asking again so the bot remembers without re-asking, and verifying that Level 2 flows still work.

That lab has no graded assessment. It is completion-based.
