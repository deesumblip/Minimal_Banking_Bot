# 8.5 Course Completion Checklist

Before moving to Level 4, ensure you can:

- [ ] Explain what a slot is and how it differs from a response or action
- [ ] Define a slot in the domain file
- [ ] Create a flow that collects a slot
- [ ] Read a slot value in an action
- [ ] Handle missing or placeholder slot values
- [ ] Understand that Level 3 builds on Level 2 (all Level 2 content remains)
