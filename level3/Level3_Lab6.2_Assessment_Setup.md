---

## Assessment Setup (For Implementers)

### Overview

Lab 6.2 is **ungraded** (completion-based). Students run Inspector and test the bot; there is no Codio assessment to configure.

### Codio Configuration

- **No Code Test or LLM Rubric** for this lab.
- Optionally add a **short reflection** or **checkbox** in the Guide (e.g. "I tested slot collection and persistence") if you want to track completion. That is Guide content only, not an autograder.

### Placement in Guide

Place Lab 6.2 content after Unit 6.2 (Testing Slot Collection) so the unit introduces the idea and the lab is the hands-on steps. The unit content can be shortened to an intro that says "Do the steps in Lab 6.2."
