Level 4 adds **multiple slots** in one flow: the bot collects several pieces of information such as amount, recipient, and source account before running an action like a transfer. You'll define multiple slots, multiple `collect:` steps, and actions that read and validate several slots. Level 3's single-slot pattern extends naturally to multiple slots.
