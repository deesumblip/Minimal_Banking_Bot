## Guide Content (For Students)

## Assessment Setup (For Implementers)

### Overview

Lab 4.1 is **ungraded** (exploration). Students read and explore `action_check_balance_simple.py` (and optionally test in Inspector after Lab 6.1). The action file is provided in the repo; no deliverable is graded.

### Assessment Type

**None.** No Code Test or LLM Rubric.

### Codio Configuration

- **No assessment** – Do not add a Standard Code Test or LLM Rubric for this lab.
- **Optional** – Add a completion checkbox or short reflection in the Guide (e.g. “I explored the action and placeholder handling”) if you want to track completion. That is Guide content only, not an autograder.
