# 8.1 Knowledge Check

(Add 3–5 multiple-choice questions here, e.g. What is a slot? Where are slots defined? What does a collect step do? How do you read a slot in an action? What is the naming convention for ask responses?)

Answer key and short explanations can be added in the same file or a separate key document.
