## Key Concepts

1. **Slots.** Memory variables that store conversation information.
2. **Slot Collection.** Using `collect:` in flows to ask for and store information.
3. **Reading Slots.** Using `tracker.get_slot()` in actions to access stored values.
4. **Ask Responses.** `utter_ask_*` responses used when collecting slots.

## Skills You've Developed

You can define slots in the domain file, collect slots in flows, read slots in actions, handle missing or placeholder slot values, and create multi-turn conversations with memory.
