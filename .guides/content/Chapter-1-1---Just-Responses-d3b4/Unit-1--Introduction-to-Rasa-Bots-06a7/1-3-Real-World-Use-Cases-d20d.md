**Level 1** bots are perfect for:

- **Company Information**: "What are your hours?", "Where are you located?"
- **Product FAQs**: "What features does this product have?", "How do I get started?"
- **Contact Information**: "How can I reach support?", "What's your email?"
- **Simple Help Systems**: "What can you help me with?", "I need assistance"

**Example Conversation:**
```
User: "Hello"
Bot: "Hi! I'm a banking assistant. How can I help you today?"

User: "What can you do?"
Bot: "I can help you with:
      - Checking your balance
      - Transferring money
      - Bank hours
      - Contact information"

User: "How do I contact you?"
Bot: "You can reach us at support@bank.com or call 1-800-BANK-123."
```

**Notice**: The bot provides information but doesn't remember anything or perform any actions.
