### 7.3 Best Practices

- **Organizing**: One flow per file; descriptive names; group related flows in folders.
- **Responses**: Clear and concise; use variations; include context for next steps.
- **Flow descriptions**: Be specific; use action verbs; include context (what information the flow provides).
- **Testing**: Test each flow individually; try different phrasings; run a full conversation; check logs if something fails.
