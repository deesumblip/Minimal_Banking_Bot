# Lab 7.2: Build Your Own Feature (Project)

**Objective**: Add a new feature to your banking bot (new response + new flow).

Create one new response in `domain/basics.yml` and one new flow in `data/basics/` that uses it. Choose something simple (e.g. branch locations, FAQ). Use clear flow names and descriptions. Test in Inspector.
