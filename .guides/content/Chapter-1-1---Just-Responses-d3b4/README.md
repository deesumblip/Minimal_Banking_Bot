# Chapter 1.1: Just Responses (ground truth)

This folder is the **single source of truth** for Level 1 (Just Responses) in both Codio and the main repo.

- **On Codio:** This chapter already exists with full content (Units 0–6). Keep using it there.
- **In this repo:** Populate this folder by copying the chapter from Codio (see migration steps below). After that, edits here sync to Codio via Git import.

**If this folder is empty or only has this README:** follow the steps in `level1/MIGRATION_LEVEL1_CHAPTER.md` to copy the full chapter from Codio into this path, then commit and push so the repo has the ground truth for future clones.
