### 6.2 How to Train Your Bot

**What you'll do**: In **Lab 6.1** you'll run the training command, see what success looks like, and fix common errors. The lab is split into **Part 1: In Codio** and **Part 2: Running locally** — follow the part that matches your setup.

**Command** (from the `level1` folder with venv active):
```bash
python -m rasa train
```

**Success**: You should see "Successfully saved model to 'models/...'" and a new `.tar.gz` file in `models/`.
