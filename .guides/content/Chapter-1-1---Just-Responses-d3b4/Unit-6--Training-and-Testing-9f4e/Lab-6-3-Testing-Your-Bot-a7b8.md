**Objective**: Test your bot thoroughly with multiple variations.

#### Task

1. Test the `greet` flow with 3 different greetings.
2. Test the `help` flow with 3 different ways to ask for help.
3. Test the `contact` flow with 3 different ways to ask for contact info.
4. Test the `goodbye` flow (if you created it).

#### Documentation

For each test, note: what you said, which flow triggered, what the bot responded, and whether it matched your expectations.

**AI Coach**: Ask "Why isn't my flow triggering?" or "How do I test if my bot works correctly?"
