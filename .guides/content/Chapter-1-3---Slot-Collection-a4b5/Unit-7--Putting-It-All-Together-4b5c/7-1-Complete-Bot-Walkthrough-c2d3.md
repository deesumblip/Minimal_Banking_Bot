A full conversation ties together Level 1 (responses), Level 2 (actions), and Level 3 (slot memory).

**Do the walkthrough in Lab 7.1: Complete Bot Walkthrough.** You will:

1. Start Inspector and run a session start → bot greets.
2. Say "Check my balance" → bot asks for account (slot empty).
3. Provide "1234" → bot stores it, runs action, replies with balance.
4. Say "What's my balance?" again → bot remembers 1234 and replies without asking (slot persistence).
5. Say "What are your hours?" → Level 2 flow runs.

Levels 1, 2, and 3 work together: responses, actions, and slot memory. No graded assessment for Lab 7.1.
