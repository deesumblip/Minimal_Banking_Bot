Your goal is to **complete** the action file that reads the `account` slot and handles placeholder values. The domain already lists `action_check_balance_simple` from Lab 3.1. First complete the script in the fill-in-the-blanks exercise below; then put the complete script in the file tree and run the assessment.

## Fill-in-the-blanks exercise

1. **Complete the script below.** Fill in the eleven blanks marked `(1)` through `(11)` in order. Each blank is a single expression or value (one line). The blanks reinforce concepts from Level 1 (domain, responses), Level 2 (actions, `run`/`name`, dispatcher), and Level 3 (slots, placeholders).

2. **Reproduce the complete script in the file tree.** Create or open `level3/actions/action_check_balance_simple.py` and paste your completed script (with all blanks filled in) into that file. Save the file.

3. **Run the final assessment.** The grader checks that the file exists, has the right structure, reads the slot, handles placeholders, and sends the balance message.

### After you finish

- **Verify** your domain (from Lab 3.1) lists `action_check_balance_simple` in the `actions:` section.
- **Run the assessment** when you're done.
- **Optional.** After Lab 6.1, train and run Inspector. Trigger the check_balance flow and watch the action use the slot and re-ask when the LLM extracts a placeholder.
