## What Level 3 Cannot Do

1. **Collect Multiple Slots Efficiently.** You can only collect one slot at a time easily. For example "Transfer money" needs amount, recipient, and account. Level 4 adds multiple slot collection.

2. **Complex Validation.** Level 3 has limited validation of slot values. For example you can't easily validate account format. You can handle some of this in actions; Level 4 makes it easier.

## When Level 3 is Sufficient

Level 3 is a good fit for a single piece of information such as account number or name, simple multi-turn conversations, and remembering one key piece of data.

## When You Need More

Move to Level 4 when you need to collect multiple pieces of information, handle complex forms with multiple fields, or validate multiple slot values together.
