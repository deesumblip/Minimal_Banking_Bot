Before moving to Level 4, ensure you can:

- Explain what a slot is and how it differs from a response or action
- Define a slot in the domain file
- Create a flow that collects a slot
- Read a slot value in an action
- Handle missing or placeholder slot values
- Understand that Level 3 builds on Level 2 and that all Level 2 content remains

If you can do all of the above, you're ready for Level 4!
