After training in Lab 6.1, you'll test the bot in Inspector to confirm slot collection and persistence.

**Lab 6.2** walks you through starting Inspector (Codio uses the Rasa Inspect tab; locally you open a browser), testing slot collection (for example "Check my balance" so the bot asks for account, then you provide it), testing slot persistence (ask again and the bot remembers without re-asking), and verifying that Level 2 flows still work.

That lab has no graded assessment. It is completion-based.
