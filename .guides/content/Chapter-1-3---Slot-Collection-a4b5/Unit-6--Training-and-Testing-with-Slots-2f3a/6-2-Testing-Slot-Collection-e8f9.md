# 6.2 Testing Slot Collection

After training (Lab 6.1), you test the bot in Inspector to confirm slot collection and persistence.

**Do the steps in Lab 6.2: Testing Slot Collection.** The lab covers:

- Starting Inspector (Codio: Rasa Inspect tab; local: browser)
- Testing slot collection ("Check my balance" → bot asks for account → you provide it)
- Testing slot persistence (ask again → bot remembers, no re-asking)
- Verifying Level 2 flows still work

No graded assessment for that lab; it is completion-based.
