Before diving into building your first Rasa bot, let's make sure you have everything set up correctly.

**Prerequisites**: Python knowledge, command line familiarity, file editing, Rasa Pro license, OpenAI API key. Plan for 2-3 hours.

**Note for Codio Students**: Start with Lab 0.1 below to create a virtual environment and install Rasa Pro. Credentials (RASA_LICENSE and OPENAI_API_KEY) are pre-configured for this course—you do not need to create a `.env` file.

**Note for Local Setup**: If you are repeating this exercise on your own machine (not in Codio), create a `.env` file in your project root with:

   ```
   RASA_LICENSE=your-rasa-pro-license-here
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   ```
Replace the placeholders with your actual license and API key. 
**Never commit `.env` to version control.**
