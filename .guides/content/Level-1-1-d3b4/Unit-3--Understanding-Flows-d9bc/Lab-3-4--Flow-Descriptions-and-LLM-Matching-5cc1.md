**Objective**: Practice writing good flow descriptions.

#### Task

For each of these scenarios, write a good flow description:

1. A flow that provides bank hours
2. A flow that explains how to check balance
3. A flow that lists available services

#### Examples

1. `description: "Tell the user when the bank is open and what the operating hours are."`
2. `description: "Explain the process for checking account balance, including what information is needed."`
3. `description: "List all the services and features the bot can help with."`

**Key**: Be specific about what the flow does, not how the user asks for it.
