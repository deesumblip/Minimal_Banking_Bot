### Your Task

You've learned how actions are structured and how they work. Now create a **new** action: `action_holiday_hours`, which returns the bank's holiday schedule **based on today's date**. If today is a holiday, the action should say we're closed today; otherwise it should return the general holiday schedule. That way the response depends on the current date—so it has to be an action, not a single `utter_*` response. Follow the steps below.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1 – Create the file**  
- In the `actions/` folder, create a new file named `action_holiday_hours.py`.

**Step 2 – Add the imports**  
At the top of the file, add:
- `from datetime import datetime` (so you can use the current date)
- `from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker`
- `from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher`  
You can also add `from typing import Any, Dict, List, Text` for type hints.

**Step 3 – Define the class**  
- Create a class named `ActionHolidayHours` that inherits from `Action`  
  (same pattern as `ActionBankHours`, but with the new name).

**Step 4 – Implement `name()`**  
- Add a method `name(self)` that returns the string `"action_holiday_hours"`  
  (this must match the filename, without `.py`).

**Step 5 – Implement `run()` with date-based logic**  
- Add the `run()` method with parameters: `dispatcher`, `tracker`, and `domain`.  
- Get today's date, e.g. `now = datetime.now()` and use `now.month` and `now.day` to check if today is a holiday.  
- **If today is a holiday** (e.g. New Year's Day Jan 1, Independence Day July 4, or Christmas Dec 25—you can use these or your own list): set a message like *"We're closed today for [holiday name]."*  
- **Otherwise**: set a message with the general holiday schedule, e.g. *"We're closed on New Year's Day, Independence Day, and Christmas. On other holidays we may have limited hours—please call ahead."*  
- Call `dispatcher.utter_message(text=message)` **once** with whichever message you chose.  
- At the end of `run()`, return `[]` (an empty list).

**Step 6 – Save and verify**  
- Save the file and run the assessment below.
