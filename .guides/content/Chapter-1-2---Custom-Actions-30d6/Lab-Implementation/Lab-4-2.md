# Lab 4.2: Multiple Actions – Assessment Setup

## Overview

Lab 4.2 reinforces that both actions are registered and adds optional Inspector exploration. The lab uses the **virtual environment in the main folder** (project root): students go to main folder, activate that venv, then `cd level2` and train/run the Level 2 bot from there so Rasa uses level2's domain, flows, and actions. Steps separate **In Codio** (Linux) from **Running locally** (Windows/macOS/Linux).

**Lab 4.2 has no separate assessment.** The assessable deliverable (both actions registered in the domain) is the same as Lab 4.1 and is fully covered by the Lab 4.1 grader. Lab 4.2 is recap plus optional "Review in Inspector" steps, which are not graded.

### Assessment Type

**None.** Do not add a Code Test for Lab 4.2. Students who passed Lab 4.1 have already satisfied the only testable outcome. If a Lab 4.2 assessment was previously configured in Codio, remove it or leave it disabled.
