		"guidance": "Temperature is a parameter that controls randomness in LLM outputs. A lower temperature like 0.3 means the model will be more focused on high-probability (safe) outputs, resulting in responses that are more consistent and predictable, though still with some creativity. Higher temperatures (closer to 1.0 or above) increase randomness and creativity, while very low temperatures (close to 0) make outputs highly deterministic.",
