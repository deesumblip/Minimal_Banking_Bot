Use greet.yml as a template for the overall structure, indentation, and field organization.\n                        \n                        1. File Location and Existence:\n                           - File data/basics/goodbye.yml exists in /home/codio/workspace/level1/\n                           - File is valid YAML (no syntax errors, parses correctly)\n                           - File is in correct location (data/basics/, not data/ root)\n                           - File structure matches the format in greet.yml (flows: section at top level, proper indentation)\n                        \n                        2. Flow Structure:\n                           - File contains a flows: section (top level, no indentation) - same structure as greet.yml\n                           - Flow named \"goodbye\" exists under flows: section\n                           - Flow is properly indented (goodbye: is 2 spaces from left margin, matching greet.yml format)\n                        \n                        3. Required Fields:\n                           - Flow has a \"name\" field (e.g., name: goodbye)\n                           - Flow has a \"description\" field (non-empty, descriptive text explaining when flow triggers)\n                           - Flow has a \"steps\" field (list of actions)\n                           - All fields are properly indented (4 spaces from left margin, under goodbye:)\n                           - Field organization matches the structure in greet.yml\n                        \n                        4. Steps Section:\n                           - steps: section contains at least one action\n                           - Action format is correct: \"- action: utter_goodbye\"\n                           - Action is properly indented (6 spaces from left margin, under steps:)\n                           - Action references existing response (utter_goodbye should exist in domain file)\n                           - Action format matches the pattern used in greet.yml\n                        \n                        5. Description Quality:\n                           - description field is not empty\n                           - description is meaningful (explains when/why flow triggers, >10 characters)\n                           - description helps LLM understand when to use this flow\n                        \n                        6. YAML Syntax and Indentation:\n                           - Uses exactly 2 spaces for indentation (not tabs, not 4 spaces) - matching greet.yml indentation style\n                           - flows: is at left margin (0 spaces)\n                           - goodbye: is indented 2 spaces\n                           - name:/description:/steps: are indented 4 spaces\n                           - - action: is indented 6 spaces\n                           - No tabs used anywhere\n                           - Overall indentation pattern matches greet.yml\n                        \n                        Grading: Award full points (12) if all requirements are met.
