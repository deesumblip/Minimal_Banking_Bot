				"description": "Requirements Checklist (all must be met):\n\n**Reference**: Review existing flow files in data/basics/ folder (e.g., greet.yml, goodbye.yml) to see examples of good descriptions.\n\n1. File Location and Existence:\n   - At least 2 flow files exist in data/basics/ folder (e.g., greet.yml, goodbye.yml, or other flows)\n   - Files are valid YAML (no syntax errors, parses correctly)\n   - Files are in correct location (data/basics/, not data/ root)\n\n2. Description Presence:\n   - Each flow has a \"description\" field\n   - All descriptions are non-empty (not just whitespace or empty strings)\n   - All descriptions are at least 20 characters long\n   - Descriptions are properly formatted as YAML strings\n\n3. Description Quality (CRITICAL - This is the main learning objective):\n   - Descriptions are specific (explain what the flow does, not vague like \"help user\" or \"flow\")\n   - Descriptions are action-oriented (use verbs like \"tell\", \"explain\", \"provide\", \"list\", \"greet\")\n   - Descriptions include context (when/why the flow triggers, what it accomplishes)\n   - Descriptions help LLM understand the flow's purpose (clear enough for matching)\n   - Descriptions avoid being too vague (not just \"help\" or \"information\")\n   - Descriptions avoid being too specific about exact user phrases (focus on what, not how user asks)\n\n4. Uniqueness:\n   - Each flow has a unique description (not identical to other flows)\n   - Descriptions are tailored to each flow's specific purpose\n   - No duplicate descriptions across different flows\n\n5. YAML Structure and Formatting:\n   - Descriptions are properly formatted (string values, correct indentation)\n   - Descriptions are under the correct flow name (4 spaces indentation under flow name)\n   - Descriptions use proper YAML syntax (quoted strings if needed, correct colon placement)\n   - No syntax errors in description field\n\n6. Integration with Flow Structure:\n   - Descriptions are part of valid flow structures (flows: section exists)\n   - Flow has other required fields (name:, steps:) in addition to description:\n\nGrading: Award full points (1) if all requirements are met, especially description quality. Descriptions must be specific, action-oriented, and helpful for LLM matching. Deduct points for missing descriptions, vague descriptions (like \"help user\"), duplicate descriptions, or descriptions that are too short (<20 characters).",
