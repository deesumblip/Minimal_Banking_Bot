		"guidance": "The correct answers are:\n\n1. The flow description is critical because the LLM uses it to match user messages to flows - This is explicitly stated as critical in the topic, as the LLM relies on descriptions to understand when to trigger flows.\n\n2. All flows in a file must be defined under the top-level `flows:` key - The topic explains that \"flows:\" is the top-level key and all flows in the file go under this key.\n\n3. Each step in a flow must be indented with a dash (`-`) - The topic specifies that under \"steps:\", each step is indented with a dash.\n\nThe incorrect options are:\n\n1. The human-readable name must match the flow identifier - The topic explicitly states that the name \"Can be different from the flow identifier\" and is used for logs and debugging.\n\n2. A vague description is sufficient - The topic emphasizes that good descriptions are essential and provides examples of bad (\"Say hello\") versus good descriptions.",
