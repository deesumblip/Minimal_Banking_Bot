		"guidance": "Custom actions are needed when the response requires dynamic content or conditional logic. In this case, the `action_bank_hours` needs to check what day of the week it is using the `datetime` module and then respond with different bank hours depending on whether it's a weekday, Saturday, or Sunday. A simple `utter_*` response can only provide static text and doesn't have access to Python logic or the ability to determine the current date/time.",
