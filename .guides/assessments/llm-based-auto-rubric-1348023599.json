				"description": "Requirements Checklist (all must be met):\n\n**Reference**: Use data/basics/greet.yml or data/basics/goodbye.yml as templates for structure and formatting.\n\n1. File Location and Existence:\n   - File data/basics/hours.yml exists in /home/codio/workspace/level1/\n   - File data/basics/balance.yml exists in /home/codio/workspace/level1/\n   - Both files are valid YAML (no syntax errors, parses correctly)\n   - Both files are in correct location (data/basics/, not data/ root)\n\n2. Flow Structure (hours.yml):\n   - File contains a flows: section (top level, no indentation)\n   - Flow named \"hours\" exists under flows: section\n   - Flow is properly indented (hours: is 2 spaces from left margin)\n   - Flow has a \"name\" field (e.g., name: bank hours)\n   - Flow has a \"description\" field (non-empty, descriptive text)\n   - Flow has a \"steps\" field (list of actions)\n   - All fields are properly indented (4 spaces from left margin, under hours:)\n\n3. Flow Structure (balance.yml):\n   - File contains a flows: section (top level, no indentation)\n   - Flow named \"balance\" exists under flows: section\n   - Flow is properly indented (balance: is 2 spaces from left margin)\n   - Flow has a \"name\" field (e.g., name: balance help)\n   - Flow has a \"description\" field (non-empty, descriptive text)\n   - Flow has a \"steps\" field (list of actions)\n   - All fields are properly indented (4 spaces from left margin, under balance:)\n\n4. Steps Sections:\n   - hours.yml steps: section contains at least one action\n   - balance.yml steps: section contains at least one action\n   - Each action format is correct: \"- action: utter_X\"\n   - Actions are properly indented (6 spaces from left margin, under steps:)\n   - Actions reference existing responses in domain/basics.yml (or student may need to create them)\n\n5. Description Quality (CRITICAL - This is the main learning objective):\n   - hours.yml description is non-empty and at least 20 characters long\n   - balance.yml description is non-empty and at least 20 characters long\n   - hours.yml description is specific (explains what the flow does, not vague like \"help user\")\n   - balance.yml description is specific (explains what the flow does, not vague like \"help user\")\n   - hours.yml description is action-oriented (uses verbs like \"tell\", \"explain\", \"provide\")\n   - balance.yml description is action-oriented (uses verbs like \"tell\", \"explain\", \"provide\")\n   - hours.yml description includes context (when/why the flow triggers, what it accomplishes)\n   - balance.yml description includes context (when/why the flow triggers, what it accomplishes)\n   - Descriptions help LLM understand each flow's purpose (clear enough for matching)\n   - Descriptions avoid being too vague (not just \"help\" or \"information\")\n   - Descriptions avoid being too specific about exact user phrases (focus on what, not how user asks)\n\n6. Description Uniqueness:\n   - hours.yml description is unique (different from balance.yml description)\n   - balance.yml description is unique (different from hours.yml description)\n   - Both descriptions are different from other existing flow descriptions (greet.yml, goodbye.yml, etc.)\n   - Each description is tailored to its flow's specific purpose\n\n7. YAML Syntax and Indentation:\n   - Uses exactly 2 spaces for indentation (not tabs, not 4 spaces)\n   - flows: is at left margin (0 spaces)\n   - Flow names (hours:, balance:) are indented 2 spaces\n   - name:/description:/steps: are indented 4 spaces\n   - - action: items are indented 6 spaces\n   - No tabs used anywhere\n   - Overall indentation pattern matches template files (greet.yml, goodbye.yml)\n\nGrading: Award full points (8) if all requirements are met, especially description quality and uniqueness. Descriptions must be specific, action-oriented, and helpful for LLM matching. Deduct points for missing files, missing descriptions, vague descriptions (like \"help user\"), duplicate descriptions, incorrect structure, or syntax errors.",
