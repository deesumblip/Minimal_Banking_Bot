It configures LLM settings for natural language generation through the `nlg` and `model_groups` sections\n\nThe file does NOT contain training data for the NLU pipeline (that would be in the `nlu.yml` file) or conversation flows (those would be in the `flows.yml` file). The `endpoints.yml` file is specifically for connecting Rasa to external services and configuring how responses are generated.",
