		"guidance": "The correct answer is that `pattern_session_start` automatically triggers an action when a conversation begins without requiring a user message. This is indicated by the `nlu_trigger: - intent: session_start` in the pattern definition, showing that it responds to the session_start intent, which is a system intent that fires automatically when a new conversation begins. The other options are incorrect because: ending conversations is handled by `pattern_completed` with its `noop: true` and `next: END` attributes; the file doesn't mention error handling; and there's no indication of database storage in the provided information.",
