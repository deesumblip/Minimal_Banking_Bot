		"guidance": "When a flow includes an action step, Rasa looks for the corresponding Python class in the actions/ folder. It then executes that action's run() method, where you can write custom logic in Python. The action can use the dispatcher.utter_message() method to send dynamic responses back to the user. This is different from template responses which are predefined in domain.yml. The action execution happens outside the flow file - the flow just specifies which action to call.",
