		"guidance": "Custom actions are necessary in this case because:\n\n1. The response changes dynamically based on the current day of the week (using datetime), which requires Python logic that can't be handled by a simple utterance.\n2. Simple utterances in Rasa are static responses that don't change based on external factors like time.\n3. When conditional logic is needed to determine what message to send to the user, custom actions are required.\n\nCustom actions are not required for all responses in Rasa - simple, static responses can use utterances. Additionally, there's no requirement to store responses in a database for this functionality.",
