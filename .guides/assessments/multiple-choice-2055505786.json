		"guidance": "The correct answers are:\n\n1. Response names must start with the prefix 'utter_' - This is a Rasa convention that must be followed when defining responses.\n\n2. Setting 'rephrase: True' in metadata allows the LLM to vary the wording while keeping the same meaning - This makes conversations feel more natural by avoiding repetitive exact phrases.\n\n3. Defining responses as a list allows for multiple message variations that Rasa can randomly select from - This is correct; when multiple text variations are provided, Rasa will randomly select one when the response is used.\n\nThe incorrect options are:\n\n- When multiple text variations are provided for a response, Rasa will use all of them in sequence - This is incorrect; Rasa randomly selects one variation rather than using them in sequence.\n\n- Responses are defined in the actions file, not the domain file - This is incorrect; responses are defined in the domain file as shown in the example.",
