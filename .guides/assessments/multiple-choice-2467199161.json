		"guidance": "The correct answer is 'To store information from the conversation so the bot can remember and use it later.' Slots function as memory variables that allow bots to persist information throughout a conversation. Without slots, bots would forget user-provided information immediately after receiving it, making them unable to maintain context or complete multi-step tasks. The example shows how a bot without slots forgets the account number immediately, while a bot with slots can remember and reuse that information later in the conversation.",
