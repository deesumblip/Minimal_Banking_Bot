		"guidance": "The correct answer is: Say \"What are your hours?\" and get a response about bank hours. This phrase triggers the Level 2 `hours` flow, and if it works correctly by providing bank hours information, it confirms that Level 2 functionality is still intact after implementing Level 3 features. The other options either test Level 3 functionality (checking balance), don't actually test functionality (restarting Inspector), or only provide debugging information without testing the actual flow (debug panel).",
