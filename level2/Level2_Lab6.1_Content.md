# Lab 6.1: Training and Testing with Actions

### Your Task

Train your bot so that it includes your actions and flows. With your virtual environment activated, run:

```bash
python -m rasa train
```

Wait for training to finish. A model file (`.tar.gz`) will be created in the `models/` folder.

---

### Verification

Before submitting, confirm:

- Training completed without errors
- A model file exists under `models/`

Run the assessment when you're done.
