# Module 8: Assessment and Next Steps

### 8.5 Course Completion Checklist

Before moving to Level 3, ensure you can:

- [ ] Explain what an action is and how it differs from a response
- [ ] Create a new action in Python (you did this in Lab 3.1 with `action_holiday_hours`)
- [ ] Register actions in the domain file (including your `action_holiday_hours`)
- [ ] Create a flow that uses an action (you created `holiday_hours.yml` for your action)
- [ ] Understand how actions are executed
- [ ] Debug when actions don't work
- [ ] Understand that Level 2 builds on Level 1 (all Level 1 content remains)

If you can check all these boxes, you're ready for Level 3!
