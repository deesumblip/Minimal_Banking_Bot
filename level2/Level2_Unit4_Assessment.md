# Lab 4.1: Registering Actions in the Domain

## Guide Content (For Students)

**Placement**: This lab follows Unit 4: Registering Actions in the Domain.

---

### Your Task

Add an `actions:` section to `domain/basics.yml` (if it isn’t already there) and register **both**:

- **action_bank_hours** – the example action you studied in the units  
- **action_holiday_hours** – the action you created in Lab 3.1  

Each action must appear as a list item under `actions:` (e.g. `- action_bank_hours`).

---

### Verification

Before submitting, confirm:

- The file `domain/basics.yml` has an `actions:` section  
- Both `action_bank_hours` and `action_holiday_hours` are listed  
- YAML is valid (correct indentation and dashes)  

Run the assessment when you’re done.

---

#### Review in Inspector (optional)

After the assessment, train and open the Rasa Inspector GUI (see Unit 6.3). In the chat, try **"What are your hours?"** (should work if the `hours` flow exists) and **"What are your holiday hours?"** (likely not yet—you'll add that flow in Unit 5).

## Assessment Setup (For Implementers)

## Overview

This assessment verifies that students can register actions in the domain file with correct YAML syntax, including both the example action and the action they created in Lab 3.1.

### Assessment Type

**Standard Code Test** (Bash script)

## Grader Script Location

### Example student deliverable (for grading reference)

Students should add or edit the `actions:` section in `domain/basics.yml` so that it lists both actions. Example snippet (the rest of the file may contain `responses:`, etc.):

```yaml
actions:
  - action_bank_hours
  - action_holiday_hours
```

## Assessment Setup and Configuration

1. **Navigate** to the Lab 4.1 section in the Codio Guide Editor.

2. **Add Code Test** – Add Code Test → **Standard Code Test**. Configure each tab as follows.

   **General** – Name: *Lab 4.1: Registering Actions in the Domain*. Description: *Verify that students can register actions in the domain file (both action_bank_hours and action_holiday_hours)*. Points: `12`. Language: `Bash`.

   **Execution** – COMMAND: `bash /home/codio/workspace/.guides/assessments/level2_graders/lab_4.1_grader.sh`. TIMEOUT: `60` seconds. Working Directory: `/home/codio/workspace/level2`.

   **Grading**
   - **Points**: `12` – Total points for this assessment.
   - **Allow partial points**: `OFF` – Single run; the script reports one pass/fail outcome, so partial credit is not used.
   - **Use maximum score**: `OFF` – No cap; the student can earn the full point value.
   - **Case insensitive**: `ON` – Output comparison ignores letter case so minor casing differences do not fail the test.
   - **Ignore white spaces**: `ON` – Extra spaces or newlines in the script output do not cause a failure.
   - **Substring match**: `ON` – Pass if the expected string appears anywhere in the output (full output need not match exactly).
   - **Test case** (one case):
     - **INPUT – Arguments**: leave empty – No command-line arguments are passed to the script.
     - **INPUT – STDIN**: leave empty – No stdin is fed to the script.
     - **Expected output**: ` PASS: Action registration verification complete!` (include the leading space) – The test passes when the script’s stdout contains this string (i.e. when all checks pass).
   - **Show expected answer**: `ALWAYS` – Students can see the required output phrase after submission.
   - **Show rationale to student**: `NEVER` (or as desired) – Controls whether the instructor rationale is shown to the student.
   - **Defined number of attempts**: `OFF` – No limit on submission attempts (or set a limit if desired).
   - **Rationale** (optional): e.g. *The grader checks that `domain/basics.yml` has an `actions:` section listing both `action_bank_hours` and `action_holiday_hours` with valid YAML.*

   **Files** – Create the grader script at `.guides/assessments/level2_graders/lab_4.1_grader.sh` and make it executable: `chmod +x .guides/assessments/level2_graders/lab_4.1_grader.sh`.

3. **Save & Test** the assessment. Enable **Learning Analytics** if desired.
