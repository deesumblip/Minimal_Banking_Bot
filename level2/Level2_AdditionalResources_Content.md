# Additional Resources

## Extension Exercises

### Exercise 1: Add More Actions

**Task**: Create additional actions for your banking bot:
- `action_account_types.py` - Returns information about account types
- `action_loan_info.py` - Returns loan information

**Goal**: Practice creating multiple actions and registering them.

### Exercise 2: Extend Dynamic Responses

**Task**: Extend `action_bank_hours.py` (which already uses `datetime` to tailor the message by day) to:
- Include the current date in the message (e.g., "As of [today's date], ...")
- Or add logic for holiday closures (e.g., check if today is a known holiday)

**Goal**: Practice building on existing dynamic logic in actions.

### Exercise 3: Action with Calculations

**Task**: Create `action_calculate_interest.py` that:
- Takes a principal amount and interest rate
- Calculates simple interest
- Returns the result

**Goal**: Practice using Python calculations in actions.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've completed Level 2 and learned how to add custom Python code to your Rasa bot.

### What You Can Do Now

- Add custom Python code to your bot
- Create dynamic responses based on logic
- Process data and perform calculations
- Integrate with external systems (with proper setup)
- Extend your Level 1 bot with new capabilities

### What's Coming Next

- **Level 3**: Add memory (slots) so the bot can remember information
- **Level 4**: Collect multiple pieces of information
- **Level 5**: Enable dynamic tool calling

### Keep Learning
