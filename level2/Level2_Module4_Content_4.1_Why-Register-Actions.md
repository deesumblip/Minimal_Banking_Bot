# Module 4: Registering Actions in the Domain

### 4.1 Why Register Actions?

Actions must be registered in the domain file so Rasa knows they exist. Without registration, Rasa won't find your actions even if the Python files exist.

**File Location**: `domain/basics.yml`

**Analogy**: Registering an action is like adding a phone number to your contacts - you need to tell Rasa "this action exists and here's its name."
