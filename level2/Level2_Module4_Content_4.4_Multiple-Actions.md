# Module 4: Registering Actions in the Domain

### 4.4 Multiple Actions

In this level you have (at least) two actions: the example **action_bank_hours** and the action you created in Lab 3.1, **action_holiday_hours**. List them both under `actions:`:

```yaml
actions:
  - action_bank_hours
  - action_holiday_hours
```

When you add more actions later, list each on its own line with a dash.
