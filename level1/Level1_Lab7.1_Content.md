# Lab 7.1: Complete Bot Walkthrough

**Objective**: Understand how all pieces work together in a complete conversation.

#### Steps

1. **Start Inspector** (if not already running).
2. **Have a complete conversation**: Open a new session (triggers `pattern_session_start`), ask for help, ask for contact info, end the conversation.
3. **Observe**: Which flow triggers for each message; use debug output to see LLM understanding; see how flows and responses connect.

**AI Coach**: Ask "How does the bot decide which flow to trigger?" or "What happens when I start a new conversation?"
