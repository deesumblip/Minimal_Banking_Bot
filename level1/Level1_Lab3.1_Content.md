# Lab 3.1: Exploring Existing Flows

**Objective**: Understand flow structure by examining existing flows.

#### Steps

1. **Navigate to the Data Folder**
   - Open the `data/basics/` folder in your IDE
   - You should see files like `greet.yml`, `help.yml`, and `contact.yml`

2. **Examine Flow Structure**
   - Open `greet.yml` and identify:
     - The `flows:` key
     - The flow identifier (`greet:`)
     - The `name:` field
     - The `description:` field (notice how it's written!)
     - The `steps:` section

3. **Compare Flows**
   - Open `help.yml` and `contact.yml`
   - Notice they all follow the same structure
   - Compare their descriptions - how are they different?

**AI Coach**: Ask questions like "Why does every flow need a description?" or "What happens if I remove the description field?"
